                <p>Its easy to feel overwhelmed with the sheer amount of information that you need to keep track of today. To be a good worker, you need to know what's going on in your boss's life as well as your company and industry. To be a good parent, you need to know how your kids are doing, how their friends are doing, and how <em>their</em> parents are doing. And this doesn't begin to cover trying to stay on top of the investments in your portfolio, your favorite sports teams, what's going on in your local city, ... the list goes on and on. </p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Solution</h2>
                <p>What is needed is a tool that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can take advantage of the abundance of RSS feeds and REST APIs available on the internet</li>
                    <li>Can make use of social media to both track the people who matter most to us as well as understand what the people who's opinions we care most about have to say about topics of interest</li>
                    <li>Automatically prioritizes and eliminates redundant information so that we can quickly see what we need to know in the limited time we have</li>
                    <li>Learns from its users to make better recommendations</li>

                <p><strong>UpToDatePal</strong> is the answer we've been waiting for. By using smart cloud technologies to scrape and aggregate information from a variety of sources, UpToDatePal will have its finger on the pulse of the people and topics that matter most to you. By using sophisticated machine learning based on user behavior, it will help save time by prioritizing what you need to read/know and by recommending additional sources of information and related topics which might be worth following. It will be available first as a responsive web application and eventually as a mobile app for Android and iOS. </p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">What UpToDatePal Needs</h2>
                <p>The beauty of UpToDatePal is that it can be built in a succession of stages, each of which can be valuable services in and of themselves. The Bitstarter here is intended to raise cash to build a proper responsive web application which works across desktop web as well as Android/iOS with a cloud backend that can ingest the necessary data and do extremely basic de-duplication and topic learning. To get there, we will need 4 engineers working for 6 months and some additional capital for server costs while developing the product.</p>
                <p>If successful, the goal is to go into private beta 4-5 months after beginning and escalate quickly into a public beta after incorporating feedback. The purpose of the public beta would be to iron out the remaining kinks.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">How Will UpToDatePal's Business Model Work?</h2>
                <p>UpToDatePal has every intention of being a business and, after the initial public beta, will go to market as a paid service, with multiple tiers corresponding to the number of people and topics being tracked. The goal is to be able to be slightly profitable on that revenue alone (although the calculations still need to be made), but the plan is to potentially raise a round of venture financing at that point to expand product development and to create a free tier to help fuel growth.</p>

                                The major risks here are that certain features get pushed out. While we will do everything we can to prevent that from happening, it is a definite risk, and one that we manage both by following best practices in software development as well as staying committed to a bias to shipping a product which is functional even if its missing a feature or two.

                                This is a particularly irritating problem but one that can probably be resolved. In the short-term, a small service is unlikely to hit the API limits but in the event that we do, we will reach out to the big social networks to plead our case as well as potentially shift towards utilizing social media data that is a bit more stale but still valuable.

                                As I mentioned above in risks -- there is a chance that some of this functionality will be pushed out to future releases. But in the short-term we are looking at basic deduplication and topic identification. Longer-term, the goal is to use machine learning to better understand which sources of information are considered more valuable as well as to determine related topics/surface information sources which were not as obvious.
